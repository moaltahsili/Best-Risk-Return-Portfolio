# Best-Risk-Return-Portfolio
This Project has two parts
## Part A
I used 5-year monthly Netflix and AMC stocks data to plot the efficient frontier and determined the minimum variance portfolio of two. /n I discussed the risk-free asset's effect to find an optimal portfolio. Then, I compared Metro Inc. and Netflix stocks (negative correlation) and Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo stocks (high positive correlation) to compare with my previous selection. Finally, I argued fundamentally what these results could mean.
